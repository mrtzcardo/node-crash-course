‘I flew around like mad to get ready, and before fortyeight
hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to
my employers, and sign the contract. In a very few hours
I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited
sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in finding
the Company’s offices. It was the biggest thing in the town,
and everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run
an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade.
‘A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high
houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead
silence, grass sprouting right and left, immense double
doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of
these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as
arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two
women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed
chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked
straight at me— still knitting with downcast eyes—and
only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as
you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up.
Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned
round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room.
I gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in the middle,
plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining
map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was
a vast amount of red—good to see at any time, because one
knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot
of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East
Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of
with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted
over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned
wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and
about me, too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed
uncanny and fateful. Often far away there I thought of these
two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as
for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously
to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and
foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes. AVE! Old knitter
of black wool. MORITURI TE SALUTANT. Not many of
those she looked at ever saw her again—not half, by a long
way.
‘There was yet a visit to the doctor. ‘A simple formality,’
assured me the secretary, with an air of taking an immense
part in all my sorrows. Accordingly a young chap wearing
his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose—there
must have been clerks in the business, though the house
was as still as a house in a city of the dead— came from
somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and
careless, with inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his
cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the
toe of an old boot. It was a little too early for the doctor,
so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein
of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the
Company’s business, and by and by I expressed casually
my surprise at him not going out there. He became very
cool and collected all at once. ‘I am not such a fool as I look,
and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb; all
along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if
Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of
rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting
into mud, whose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the
contorted mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity
of an impotent despair. Nowhere did we stop long
enough to get a particularized impression, but the general
sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was
like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.
‘It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of
the big river. We anchored off the seat of the government.
But my work would not begin till some two hundred miles
farther on. So as soon as I could I made a start for a place
thirty miles higher up.
‘I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain
was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me
on the bridge. He was a young man, lean, fair, and morose,
with lanky hair and a shuffling gait. As we left the miserable
little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore.
‘Been living there?’ he asked. I said, ‘Yes.’ ‘Fine lot these
government chaps—are they not?’ he went on, speaking
English with great precision and considerable bitterness. ‘It
is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month.
I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry?’
I said to him I expected to see that soon. ‘So-o-o!’ he
exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly.
‘Don’t be too sure,’ he continued. ‘The other day I
took up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a
their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces
like grotesque masks—these chaps; but they had bone,
muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that
was as natural and true as the surf along their coast. They
wanted no excuse for being there. They were a great comfort
to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to
a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not
last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once,
I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the
coast. There wasn’t even a shed there, and she was shelling
the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars
going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag;
the muzzles of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the
low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let
her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity
of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible,
firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the six-inch
guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white
smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble
screech—and nothing happened. Nothing could happen.
There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of
lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated
by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a
camp of natives—he called them enemies!— hidden out of
sight somewhere.

ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day) and
went on. We called at some more places with farcical names,
